## Environment Variables and Your SendGrid API Key

### Initial Setup

* copy the .env_sample file to .env
```bash
cp .env_sample .env
```

* open and add the params into this file (.env)

* then source the file
```bash
source ./.env
```

All of our examples assume you are using [environment variables](https://github.com/sendgrid/open-source-library-data-collector#environment-variables) to hold your SendGrid API key.

If you choose to add your SendGrid API key directly (not recommended):

`apikey=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY')`

becomes

`apikey='SENDGRID_API_KEY'`

In the first case, SENDGRID_API_KEY is in reference to the name of the environment variable, while the second case references the actual SendGrid API Key.

## Versioning Convention

We follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme as described by [SemVer.org](http://semver.org). Therefore, we recommend that you always pin (or vendor) the particular version you are working with to your code and never auto-update to the latest version. Especially when there is a MAJOR point release since that is guaranteed to be a breaking change. Changes are documented in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/open-source-library-data-collector/CHANGELOG.md) and [releases](https://github.com/sendgrid/open-source-library-data-collector/releases) section.
